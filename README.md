## Overview


### Sprint 1 notes:
For my first sprint of 3 days, I had decided on designing the wireframes for the frontend and model framework for the backend, since I also had a commitment to rehearsing a play.
* 24/11/23 - 26/11/23
* During this process I had decided to include a friend model, so that only friends would be able to colaborate with each other and so as to not be spammed by unknown users. I also included the Project and Task model so that bigger pieces of work could be made into smaller bite sizes. This made the app more of a team building web application rather than a reminding app, which felt much more applicable.

### Sprint 2 notes
For my second sprint I had gotten started on creating the drf-api for my application.
* 28/11/23
* User stories template and issues were created for the backend repository.
* Profiles app was created, committed and pushed to the repository.
